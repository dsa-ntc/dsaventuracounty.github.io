<p>At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.</p>
  <p>We support reforms that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decrease the influence of money and corporate interests in politics</li>
    <li>Empower working-class people in their workplaces and the economy</li>
    <li>Restructure gender and cultural relationships to be more equitable</li>
    <li>Dismantle the police state and military industrial complex</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We are activists committed to democracy as not simply one of our political values, but our means of restructuring society. Our vision is a society in which people have a real voice in the choices and relationships that affect the entirety of their lives. We call this vision democratic socialism â€” a vision of a more free, democratic and humane society.</p>
